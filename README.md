# Finance-Data-Project
In this data project we will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. This project is not meant to be a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice. We'll focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis all the way to early 2016.
Note:-
Some of the visualizations may not be visible on github. To see the full project, download and run the code on your system after installing all the necessary python libraries.
