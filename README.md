# Finance-Data-Project
In this data project we will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. This project is not meant to be a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice. We'll focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis all the way to early 2016.


We will use stock information for the following banks from 1st January 2006 to 1st January 2016:

Bank of America,
CitiGroup,
Goldman Sachs,
JPMorgan Chase,
Morgan Stanley,
Wells Fargo
